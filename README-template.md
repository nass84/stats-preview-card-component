### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

- Playing with filters can add colour to a grey image
   filter: sepia(50%) hue-rotate(220deg) saturate(900%) brightness(60%);

- For Maximum size put a font but to shrink text you can use viewport units 

h1 {
  font-size: 5.9vw;
}
h2 {
  font-size: 3.0vh;
}
p {
  font-size: 2vmin;
}

- How to embed google fonts 

- When uploading local images don't leave the \ in.

- You can loose a whole evening trying to get sizing perfect 

### Continued development

Start with Flex as when i tried to add it afterwards it made everything disapear
